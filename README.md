## Overview

The Stellar Object Position Server is a Python application designed to receive and process stellar object position data. It uses a socket-based server to accept incoming connections and parse the received data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- [bitstring](https://pypi.org/project/bitstring/): A module for parsing binary data.
- [coords](https://github.com/yourusername/coords): A custom module for working with coordinates (please replace with the actual repository or library name).

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install bitstring
# Install the 'coords' library as per your project requirements.

Installation

    Clone this GitHub repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository


    Install the required Python libraries (see prerequisites section).

Usage

To use this Stellar Object Position Server, follow these steps:

    Run the server by executing the server.py script:

    bash

    python server.py

    The server will start and listen on localhost at port 10001.

    Connect to the server using a client application that sends stellar object position data to the server.

    The server will receive and process the data, printing the received stellar object position to the console.
